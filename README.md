- Data Summarization: Relevant statistics and summary metrics were calculated to gain a broad overview of the dataset, such as average customer satisfaction scores and call durations.
- Customer Sentiment Analysis: The customer sentiment data was analyzed to determine the overall sentiment distribution and identify any trends in customer feedback.
- Call Center Performance: The performance of call center employees was assessed based on response times, call durations, and customer satisfaction scores.
- Reason for Call Analysis: The reasons cited by customers for calling the call center were analyzed to identify the most common issues or concerns.
- Interactive Dashboard: All the insights and visualizations generated during the analysis were combined into an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard allowed users to explore the data and gain real-time insights from different angles.
